# My Ugly Stuff  React Project App
<p>This project basically describes how React and Redux combines to make a feature on the web occurs or phenomenates.
  this project also show the usage of th CRUD application of redux, thus Create,Read,Update and Delete,but in this project, I did not use Update, since all that i was required in the application was create,read and delete.
  Since react is always needed in such projects, there's the need to always pass values from parent to the child and the redux which basically mean to bring back actions.
  I did use Bootstrap to style up some aspects of the project.
